# Kathy's Garden Planner

Kathy's Garden Planner is a simple site to plan and manage a garden. It
supports adding plants on a per user basis, calculating approximate values of
each plant, and a calendar of upcoming events.

## Known Issues

* Editing a plant does not queue changes, changes are made immediately
* Creating calendar event does not immediately try to get ID
* getCalendarEvents does not use start and end date to filter query
* Errors do not show an error message, affected items simply disappear
